<h1>Installing ActiveGo on Linux</h1>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>

<p>Before you start the installation, you need to ensure that your system meets the prerequisites, and that you do not have
other Go distributions that are going to conflict with ActiveGo.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Linux 64-bit</li>
<li>1 GB hard disk space</li></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="existing-go-installations">Existing Go installations</h3>

<p>ActiveGo can usually co-exist with other Go installations, but only one Go can be first on your PATH environment variable at a time.
This determines which Go installation is run when you type <code>go</code> at the command prompt. The ActiveGo installation places the path to ActiveGo at the start of your path, making it the default Go installation on your system.</p>
<p>By default, the installer will install the ActiveGo distribution in <code>/opt/ActiveGo-<version></code> and set your PATH and GOPATH environment variables in your <code>$HOME/.profile</code> file.</p>


<h2>Interactive installation</h2>

<p>You can install ActiveGo on Linux by extracting a standard tarball (<code>*.tar.gz</code>) file and running an installation script. You must have write access to the installation folder, but you do not need *root* (Administrator) privileges to complete the installation unless the directory you are installing to requires these rights.
<p>You can use either the standard interactive installation, or you can specify all of the required information on the command line so that the installation runs automatically.</p>

<p>To install ActiveGo interactively, download the package to a temporary directory, extract the files, and run the <code>install.sh</code> install script without any arguments.</p>
<p>For example, use this sequence of commands to extact and install ActiveGo.

<pre>
<code class="language-bash">
% tar xzf ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
% cd ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;
% sudo ./install.sh
</code>
</pre>

<p>**NOTE: The <code>sudo</code> command is used because the default install location (*/opt/ActiveGo-<version>*) does require root privileges.</p>

<p>The install script will verify that you accept the terms in the license agreement and allow you to specify the installation directory for ActiveGo.</p>
<p>You need to configure <a href="#envar">envronment variables</a> to complete the installation.</p>

<h2 id="non-interactive-install">Non-interactive install</h2>

<p>By default the install script will prompt you for an install directory.
You can avoid this interaction by specifying the install directory with
the <code>--prefix &lt;installdir&gt;</code> option.</p>

<p>The following example installs ActiveGo in the default directory and accepts the end user license agreement, but does not check for updates.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo ./install.sh --prefix /opt/ActiveGo-1.8.3 --license-accepted --no-update-check
</code></pre>

<p>Enter <code>./install.sh -h</code> to view complete usage information.</p>

<h2 name="envar">Configuring environment variables for ActiveGo</h2>
<p>After you complete the installation, you need to configure your PATH and GOPATH environment variables.</p>
<p>Enter the following at the bottom of either <code>/etc/profile</code> file (for a system-wide installation)
or the <code>$HOME/.profile</code> file (for your account only) to specify the location of your GOPATH, which points to your Go workspace.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
MY_GOPATH=<GO_WORKSPACE_PATH> && source /opt/ActiveGo-1.8.3/ActiveGo-Environment.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
MY_GOPATH=$HOME/go && source /opt/ActiveGo-1.8.3/ActiveGo-Environment.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Open a new terminal window, or <code>source</code> the shell configuration file (i.e. <code>source /etc/profile</code>) to enable the configuration changes. To verify that ActiveGo is installed and configured, enter:
<code>godoc -play -http=:6060</code> to test your ActiveGo installation. Once the godoc server starts you can access a local instance of the ActiveGo help at http://localhost:6060.

<p>After installing and configuring ActiveGo, read the <a href="/start/">Getting Started</a> pages in this guide for a general introduction to ActiveGo on your platform and pointers to documentation that will be most useful to you.</p>
<p>ActiveGo supports integration with TensorFlow, an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence, with the TensorFlow for Go package. For information on configuring ActiveGo to work with TensorFlow, see <a href="/get/tensorflow/">Configuring TensorFlow for ActiveGo</a>.
<h2 id="uninstalling-the-as-package">Uninstalling ActiveGo</h2>

<p>If you need to uninstall ActiveGo, you can do so by removing the directory where you installed ActiveGo and removing any associated environment variables you configured.</p>
