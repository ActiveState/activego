<h1>Installing ActiveGo on macOS </h1>

<p>You can install the macOS package using the standard user interface, or by using the command line.</p>

<p>ActiveGo is distributed on macOS as an installer package (<code>.pkg</code> bundle) that you run to install ActiveGo.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>

<p>Before you start the installation, you need to ensure that your system meets the prerequisites, and that you do not have
other Go distributions that are going to conflict with ActiveGo.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
    <li>macOS 10.9 "Mavericks" or later</li>
    <li>1 GB hard disk space; Intel 64-bit processor</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="existing-go-installations">Existing Go installations</h3>

<p>ActiveGo can usually co-exist with other Go installations, but only one Go can be first on your PATH environment variable at a time.
This determines which Go installation is run when you type <code>go</code> in Terminal. The ActiveGo installation places the path to ActiveGo at the start of your path, making it the default Go installation on your system.</p>
<p>By default, the installer will install the ActiveGo distribution in <code>/usr/local/ActiveGo-<version></code> and set your PATH and GOPATH environment variables in your <code>$HOME/.profile</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="installing-with-package">Installing with Package</h2>

<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.activestate.com/activego" target="_blank">Download</a> the ActiveGo package installer (<code>ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;-macosx.pkg</code>).</li>
    <li>Double-click the ActiveGo installer package to start the installation.</li>
    <li>Follow the installer prompts. The installer will ask for administrative authentication if the current user does not have administrative privileges.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="installing-with-the-package-command-line-tool">Installing with the Package command line tool</h2>

<p>macOS includes a command-line tool, <code>installer</code>, for installing macOS packages non-interactively from the command line. This can be
useful for remote administration.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo installer -pkg ~/Downloads/ActiveGo-<version>.pkg -target /
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is sometimes useful to create an install log file. For example, if you are running into issues and need to send the log to ActiveState technical support).
To create a log file during installation, use the <code>-verbose</code> and <code>-dumplog</code> flags:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo installer -pkg ~/Downloads/ActiveGo-<version>.pkg \
-target / -verbose -dumplog &gt; install.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<h2>Verifying your installation</h2>
<p>To verify that ActiveGo is installed and configured, enter:
<code>godoc -play -http=:6060</code> to test your ActiveGo installation. Once the godoc server starts you can access a local instance of the ActiveGo help at http://localhost:6060.

<p>After installing and configuring ActiveGo, read the <a href="/start/">Getting Started</a> pages in this guide for a general introduction to ActiveGo on your platform and pointers to documentation that will be most useful to you.</p>

<p>ActiveGo supports integration with TensorFlow, an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence, with the TensorFlow for Go package. For information on configuring ActiveGo to work with TensorFlow, see <a href="/get/tensorflow/">Configuring TensorFlow for ActiveGo</a>.
<h2 id="uninstalling-the-macos-package">Uninstalling the macOS Package</h2>

<p>If you need to uninstall ActiveGo, you can do so by running the following command in Terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
/usr/local/ActiveGo-<version>/misc/activego-uninstall
</code></pre>
