<h1>Installing ActiveGo on Windows </h1>

<p>Windows is the only supported platform for the beta release of ActiveGo. macOS and Linux will be supported in future releases.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements before you start the installation.
    The ActiveGo 1.8 Beta release has the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Windows 64-bit (amd64); Windows 7, or later</li>
    <li>The installation requires at least 1.5 GB of hard drive space</li>
    </ul>   

<h3 id="existing-go-installations">Existing Go installations</h3>
    <p>The ActiveGo installer will automatically detect if another release of Go is installed by looking for existing GOROOT and GOPATH environment variables.
    If either variable is found, the installer will warn you about the existing installation and ask you if  you want to continue.</p>

    <p>We recommend that you uninstall any existing Go installations before installing ActiveGo.
    If this is not possible, ensure that you take the following precautions when completing a side-by-side installation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose a directory name for ActiveGo that will not conflict with your existing installation.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the installer will not overwrite any of your existing Go directories.</li>
        <li>Remove the PATH and environment variables associated with any existing Go installations.</li>
    </ul>
    

<ol>
<li>Set GOROOT to location where ActiveGo is installed, and rename any existing GOROOT to OLD_GOROOT our Go installation location</li>
<li>Set the GOPATH relative to our GOROOT, and rename any existing GOPATH to OLD_GOPATH></li>
<li>Add the ActiveGo <code>go/bin</code> directory to the start of your PATH environment variable to ensure that the ActiveGo executable is used on the command line.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="accessing-remote-repositories">Accessing remote source control repositories</h3>

<p>If you need to access projects located in remote repositories using the <code>go get</code> command, you need to install the appropriate command line tools for the repository.
You can find the appropriate tools for Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and Bazaar here: <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoGetTools">https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoGetTools</a></p>

<p>A missing error message indicates that required tools are not installed. For example: <code>go: missing Git command</code></p>

<h2 id="installing-activego-using-the-windows-installer">Installing ActiveGo using the Windows installer</h2>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.activestate.com/activego" target="_blank">Download</a> the ActiveGo installer (<code>ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe</code>).</li>
<li>When the download completes, double-click <code>ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe</code> to start the installation process.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts on screen to complete the installation. <!--You need to provide the following information:-->
</ol>
<!--
<h2 id="installing-activego-on-the-command-line">Installing ActiveGo on the command line</h2>

<p>Syntax:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code.>/i</code.>: Install</li>
    <li><code>//</code>: Required to pass MSIEXEC parameters to the EXE installer</li>
    <li><code>/qn+</code>: Quiet with no prompts from the user interface</li>
    <li><code>/L*v logfile_name</code>: Create the specified log file and log in verbose mode</li>
    <li><code>INSTALLDIR=<path></code>: The directory to install ActiveGo in.</li>
</ul>

<p>To install ActiveGo from the command line, you need to start a command prompt as administrator. For example:</p>
<code>ActiveGo-1.8.0.1800-beta-win64.exe /i // /qn /l*v activego.log INSTALLDIR=C:\ActiveGo_1_8</code>


<!--<h2 id="verifying-your-installation">Verifying your installation</h2>-->

<h2 id="uninstalling-activego">Uninstalling ActiveGo</h2>
<p>If you uninstall ActiveGo using the Setup Wizard or <strong>Add or Remove Programs</strong>, the installer removes the GOROOT and GOPATH values set by the ActiveGo setup wizard,
and removes the <code>go/bin</code> directory from your PATH. It does not reset any of these settings to the previous values set by an earlier installation.
You will need to restore these values manually. If you had GOPATH and GOROOT environment varibles set when you installed ActiveGO,
they are are still available as OLD_GOPATH and OLD_GOROOT and can be restored by renaming them back to GOPATH and GOROOT.</p>
<!--
To uninstall ActiveGo from the command line, you need to start a command prompt as Administrator. For example:
<code>ActiveGo-1.8.0.1800-beta-win64.exe /x // /l*v activego.log</code>-->
