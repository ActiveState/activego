<h1>Installing ActiveGo on Windows</h1>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements before you start the installation.
    The ActiveGo 1.8.3 release has the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Windows 64-bit (amd64); Windows 7, or later</li>
        <li>The installation requires at least 1 GB of hard drive space</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="existing-go-installations">Existing Go installations</h3>
    <p>The ActiveGo installer will automatically detect if another release of Go is installed by looking for existing GOROOT and GOPATH environment variables.
    If either variable is found, the installer will warn you about the existing installation and ask you if you want to continue.</p>
    <p>If you installed the beta version of ActiveGo 1.8.0, you must uninstall it before you install the 1.8.3 release.</p>
    <p>We recommend that you uninstall any other existing Go distributions before installing ActiveGo.
    If this is not possible, ensure that you take the following precautions when completing a side-by-side installation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose a directory name for ActiveGo that will not conflict with your existing installation.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the installer will not overwrite any of your existing Go directories.</li>
        <li>Remove the PATH and environment variables associated with any existing Go installations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the ActiveGo Setup Wizard is complete, you must make the following configuration changes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set GOROOT to point to the location where ActiveGo is installed, and rename your existing GOROOT environment variable to OLD_GOROOT</li>
        <li>Set the GOPATH relative to our GOROOT, and rename your existing GOPATH to OLD_GOPATH></li>
        <li>Add the ActiveGo <code>go/bin</code> directory to the start of your PATH environment variable to ensure that the ActiveGo executable is used on the command line.</li>
    </ol>

<h3 id="accessing-remote-repositories">Accessing remote source control repositories</h3>

<p>If you need to access projects located in remote repositories, such as git, using the <code>go get</code> command, you need to install the appropriate command line tools for the repository.
You can find the appropriate tools for Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and Bazaar here: <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoGetTools">https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoGetTools</a></p>

<p>A "missing" error message indicates that required tools are not installed. For example: <code>go: missing Subversion command</code> indicates that the Subversion command line tools are missing.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-activego-setup-wizard">Using the ActiveGo Setup Wizard</h2>

<p>There are two ways to install ActiveGo with the Setup Wizard:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can run the Setup Wizard and enter the required information to install the software.</li>
<li>If you want to automate the installation, you can run the Setup Wizard from the command line.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="running-the-activego-setup-wizard">Running the ActiveGo Setup Wizard</h3>

<p>When you install ActiveGo, you should run the Setup Wizard as an Administrator.</p>
<p>Running the installation as an Administrator allows other users on the computer to use ActiveGo,
and ensures that all of ActiveGo&rsquo;s features function correctly.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.activestate.com/activego" target="_blank">Download</a> the ActiveGo Setup Wizard (<code>ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe</code>).</li>
<li>Right-click the .exe file and select <strong>Run As Administrator</strong>.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts on screen to complete the installation.</li>
</ol>

<p>See the <a href="../../start/windows/">Getting started with ActiveGo on Windows</a> for a general introduction to ActiveGo on your
platform, and pointers to documentation that will be most useful to you.</p>

<h3 id="running-the-activego-setup-wizard-on-the-command-line">Running the ActiveGo Setup Wizard on the command line</h3>

<p>You can install ActiveGo from the command line. You should start the command prompt
as an Administrator to ensure the the installation can complete successfully. ActiveGo&rsquo;s installer uses Windows Installer technology, which allows
you to partially control the install from the command line.</p>

<h4 id="starting-the-setup-wizard">Starting the Setup Wizard</h4>

<p>You can start the Setup Wizard from the command line, and walk through the installation steps in the user interface.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">c:\&gt; ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe
</code></pre>

<h4 id="logging-the-setup-wizard-output">Logging the Setup Wizard output</h4>

<p>If you want to enable logging you can add the appropriate command line switches to specify the level of logging and the log file location. The following command will generate a log of the install in &ldquo;install.log&rdquo; in the current directory.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">c:\&gt; ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe /L*v ./install.log
</code></pre>

<h4 id="specifying-a-custom-installation-directory">Specifying a custom installation directory</h4>

<p>You can also specify a custom installation directory instead of using the default.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">c:\&gt; ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe APPDIR=C:\apps\Go
</code></pre>

<p>You can combine command line options to complete your custom installation from the command line.

<pre><code class="language-bash">c:\&gt; ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe /qn+ APPDIR=C:\apps\Go /L*v ./install.log
</code></pre>

<!--
<h5 id="specifying-the-features-to-install">Specifying the features to install</h5>

<p>ActiveGo is divided into features. In the
&ldquo;Customize Setup&rdquo; dialog you can select which features to install. You can
also do this on the command line with the ADDLOCAL property. For example, the
following command will install just the core ActiveGo functionality (i.e.
not the PyWin32 extensions or the documentation.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">c:\&gt; ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe ADDLOCAL=core
</code></pre>

<p>The current set of ActiveGo Setup Wizard features are:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">    core            ActiveGo core (must be installed)
        doc         Documentation
</code></pre>

<p>Where the hierarchy denotes dependencies you must install them. For example, to install
<code>doc</code> you must install the ActiveGo core (<code>core</code>).</p>

<h4 id="complete-installation-example">Complete installation example</h4>

<p>You can combine command line options to complete your custom installation from the command line. For example, the following command will install just the ActiveGo core and
documentation to <code>C:\apps\Go</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">c:\&gt; ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe /qn+ APPDIR=&quot;C:\apps\Go&quot; ^
     /L*v ./install.log ADDLOCAL=core
</code></pre>

<p>For more information about the command line installation options, contact <a href="mailto:support@activestate.com">support@activestate.com</a></p>
-->
<h3 id="uninstalling-activeGo">Uninstalling ActiveGo</h3>

<p>ActiveGo can be uninstalled using the <strong>Uninstall ActiveGo</strong> shortcut in the <strong>ActiveGo</strong> program group in the Windows Start menu, or <strong>Add/Remove
Programs</strong> in the Control Panel.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you use the Setup Wizard (.exe) file to uninstall ActiveGo on the command line and optionally write the progress to a log file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
c:\&gt; ActiveGo-&lt;version&gt;.exe /x // /L*v ./uninstall.log
</code></pre>

<p>If you had GOPATH and GOROOT environment varibles previously set, and renamed them when you installed ActiveGO,
they are available as OLD_GOPATH and OLD_GOROOT and can be restored by renaming them back to GOPATH and GOROOT.</p>
